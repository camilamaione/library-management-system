It is also suitable for individuals seeking an introduction to data mining. The text assumes only a modest statistics or mathematics background, and no database knowledge is needed. Introduction to Data Mining presents fundamental concepts and algorithms for those learning data mining for the first time. Each concept is explored thoroughly and supported with numerous examples. The text requires only a modest background in mathematics. Each major topic is organized into two chapters, beginning with basic concepts that provide necessary background for understanding each data mining technique, followed by more advanced concepts and algorithms. Teaching and Learning Experience This program will provide a better teaching and learning experience-for you and your students. It will help: *Present Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms: Written for the beginner, this text provides both theoretical and practical coverage of all data mining topics.*Support Learning: Instructor resources include solutions for exercises and a complete set of lecture slides.',2018,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610fgmRIfFL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'),(2,'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning','Christopher M. Bishop','Springer',3,0,2,'738','This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.',2011,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FKyOeM7KL._SX368_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'),(3,'Professional JavaScript for Web Developers','Nicholas C. Zakas','Wrox Press',5,0,1,'960','This book provides a developer-level introduction along with more advanced and useful features of JavaScript. Coverage includes: JavaScript use with HTML to create dynamic webpages, language concepts including syntax and flow control statements; variable handling given their loosely typed nature; built-in reference types such as object and array; object-oriented programing; powerful aspects of function expressions; Browser Object Model allowing interaction with the browser itself; detecting the client and its capabilities; Document Object Model (DOM) objects available in DOM Level 1; how DOM Levels 2 and 3 augmented the DOM; events, legacy support, and how the DOM redefined how events should work; enhancing form interactions and working around browser limitations; using the <canvas > tag to create on-the-fly graphics; JavaScript API changes in HTML5; how browsers handle JavaScript errors and error handling; features of JavaScript used to read and manipulate XML data; the JSON data format as an alternative to XML; Ajax techniques including the use of XMLHttpRequest object and CORS; complex patterns including function currying, partial function application, and dynamic functions; offline detection and storing data on the client machine; techniques for JavaScript in an enterprise environment for better maintainability. This book is aimed at three groups of readers: Experienced object-oriented programming developers looking to learn JavaScript as it relates to traditional OO languages such as Java and C++; Web application developers attempting to enhance site usability; novice JavaScript developers. Nicholas C. Zakas worked with the Web for over a decade. He has worked on corporate intranet applications used by some of the largest companies in the world and large-scale consumer websites such as MyYahoo! and the Yahoo! homepage. He regularly gives talks at companies and conferences regarding front-end best practices and new technology.',2016,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FKyOeM7KL._SX368_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'),(4,'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software','Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Grady Booch','Addison-Wesley Professional',6,0,1,'395','Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.',1994,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kuc0iWoKL.jpg'),(5,'Understanding Digital Signal Processing','Richard G.

Richard G. Lyons has updated and expanded his best-selling second edition to reflect the newest technologies, building on the exceptionally readable coverage that made it the favorite of DSP professionals worldwide. He has also added hands-on problems to every chapter, giving students even more of the practical experience they need to succeed. Comprehensive in scope and clear in approach, this book achieves the perfect balance between theory and practice, keeps math at a tolerable level, and makes DSP exceptionally accessible to beginners without ever oversimplifying it. Readers can thoroughly grasp the basics and quickly move on to more sophisticated techniques. This edition adds extensive new coverage of FIR and IIR filter analysis techniques, digital differentiators, integrators, and matched filters. Lyons has significantly updated and expanded his discussions of multirate processing techniques, which are crucial to modern wireless and satellite communications. He also presents nearly twice as many DSP Tricks as in the second edition—including techniques even seasoned DSP professionals may have overlooked.',2010,'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HicGhi1HL._SX361_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg'),(6,'Psychology: Briefer Course','William James','Franklin Classics',4,0,1,'500','This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.
